# Contributing

Thank you for thinking to contribute! (or just being curious about that page)

The bigger a project gets, the more necessary to have rules to focus everybody's efforts in an efficient way.
This page gives some guidelines that should be followed to contribute to the project. Obviously, these rules will evolve with time and you are very welcome to suggest modifications of them if you believe they do not make sense.

Please always keep in mind that SciFin serves a certain purpose, and as such its development should make the code move towards that goal. You can read about the objectives of SciFin in the [Readme](https://github.com/SciFin-Team/SciFin/blob/master/README.md) file.

## Coding conventions

**Generalities:**

- Every function or class we write should have at least a docstring with a short description of its purpose. Doctrings start with """ and end with """.

- Every function or class whose internal operations are not obvious to a "naive reader" should have comments explaining the main operations leading to the result. Comments start with #.

- When a function has several arguments (or when a class has several attributes), it is advised to complete the docstring with the list of arguments (or attributes). The more the arguments (or attributes), the stronger the recommandation to implement that documentation.

- When returned objects are not obvious, a Returns section should be added. A Notes section can also be used to give precisions about the choices made for development and to give references to the reader.


**Templates:**

To help development and avoid too much typing, some templates for functions and classes are provided in [coding_templates.txt](https://github.com/SciFin-Team/SciFin/wiki/docs/coding_templates.md).
