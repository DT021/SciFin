def individual(number_of_genes, upper_limit, lower_limit, sum_target):
    """
    Function that creates an individual from random values that we call genes.
    These genes can represent the investment into a market or any other value in a pool of possible values.
    
    Arguments:
    - number_of_genes: it is the number of genes (but it can also be the number of assets in the market).
    - upper_limit: that's the maximum value taken by the genes (or amount we invest), before normalization.
    - lower_limit: that's the minimum value taken by the genes (or amount we invest), before normalization.
    - sum_target: that's the sum value of the genes (or the total investment that will be reached), after normalization.
    
    Note: this function has a little bug that turns out funny. If the sum of all the values is negative, then the normalization will reverse the sign,
    and we will end up having a portfolio which has flipped signes, hence specified long positions become short, and conversely. So I just put a small test.
