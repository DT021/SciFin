IMPORTANT:
----------

Once several people work on the same piece of code, one should all remember to create our own development branch
before proceeding with coding. Once functions work correctly and with agreement among contributors, the merger will be done.


Good practice syntax:
---------------------

- Avoid starting description of a function with "Function that ..." or "Method that ...".
- Avoid starting description of parameters with "The" or "A".
- Use 'DataFrame' to refer to the pandas object and 'data frame' to refer to it in a more general context.
- Same for classes like 'TimeSeries' with 'time series' or 'CatTimeSeries' with 'categorical time series'.
- Try to use infinite form of verbs in comments, e.g. 'Create a variable' instead of 'Creating a variable'.
- Cite only reliable sources.
