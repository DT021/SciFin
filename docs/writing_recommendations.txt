IMPORTANT:
----------

Once several people work on the same piece of code, one should all remember to create our own development branch before proceeding with coding. Once functions work correctly and with agreement among contributors, the merger will be done.

Though commits should be pushed normally on the local branch at the latest at the end of the day (to avoid losses), it is importand when several people work on the same branch to push several commits only after having made sure that the other dependent functions are working (and unit tests are not return errors).



Good practice syntax:
---------------------

- Avoid starting description of a function with "Function that ..." or "Method that ...".
- Avoid starting description of parameters with "The" or "A".
- Use 'DataFrame' to refer to the pandas object and 'data frame' to refer to it in a more general context.
- Same for classes like 'TimeSeries' with 'time series' or 'CatTimeSeries' with 'categorical time series'.
- Try to use base form of verbs in comments, e.g. 'Create a variable' instead of 'Creating a variable'.
- Cite only reliable sources.
- When deciding for a name of function, try to follow the pattern method_quantity, for example historical_variance.
- keep small caps for variables, except for a one-letter variable name (e.g. N, T).
- keep capital letters from classes (e.g. TimeSeries, Distributions)
- For arguments of a function, place most important first and least important last so that from left to write we go from most important to least important arguments.
