# SciFin
SciFin is a python package for Science &amp; Finance.

## Summary

The SciFin Python package is designed to gather and develop methods for scientific studies and financial services. It originates from the observation that numerous methods developed in scientific fields (such as mathematics, physics, biology and climate sciences) have direct applicability in finance and that, conversely, multiple methods developed in finance can benefit science. The development goal of this package is to offer a toolbox that can be used to derive specific applications both in research and business. Its purpose is not only to bring these fields together, but also to increase interoperability between them, helping science turn into business and finance to get new insights from science.


## Contents

The current development is focused on the following topics:
- Time series analysis (module `timeseries`)
- Monte Carlo simulations (module `montecarlo`)
- Genetic algorithms (module `geneticalg`)
- Classification techniques (module `classifier`)
- Neural networks (module `neuralnets`)
